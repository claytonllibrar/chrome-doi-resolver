# chrome-doi-resolver

This is a super lightweight chrome extensions which resolves DOIs. It is intended for use by Wayne State University affiliates as it runs the entered DOI through our proxy server and citation resolver protocols in order to provide access.

Currently has no authentication or validation built in, I'll probably get working on that at some point.
